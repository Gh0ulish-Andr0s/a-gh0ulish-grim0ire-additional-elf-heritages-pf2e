    <b><i>A Gh0ulish Grim0ire</i></b><br>
    <b>Additional Elf Heritages</b><br>
    <i>a Foundry VTT module for Pathfinder 2e</i>
</p>
<p></p>
If you are a fan of the concept of elves capable of living on the periphery of civilization in places semi-hospitable to humans, this module expands the list of available elf heritages for the Pathfinder 2e system to include elves adapted to the remaining natural terrain types not currently covered by the system. Additionally, there is also an uncommon elf heritage for more industrial settings where exists elves adapted to life in more technologically-advanced and polluted urban landscapes. This module is the first content release of \"A Gh0ulsih Grim0ire\", a collection of Pathfinder 2e compendiums available on Foundry Virtual Tabletop produced by Gh0ulish Andr0s. This module and all others in the collection will be free and open to use at your table, homebrew into your own, or re-distribute to your fellow GMs! But if you wish to support more content updates, you may do so at https://ko-fi.com/gh0ulishandr0s."

<b>Known Issues</b>
<p>I plan on making another pass at the Rules Elements attached to some of the heritages (e.g. Sky Elf). Be on the look out for a version 1.1.0 if changes are made.</p>

<b>Expected Updates</b>
<p>Barring the above mentioned, unless there is a drastic change in how the Pathfinder 2e system handles the rules, there should not be a need to make regular updates to the module. Future updates may also occur in response to player/GM feedback. Also, in the event of Paizo releasing official versions of this same content, I may decide to archive my version.</p>
